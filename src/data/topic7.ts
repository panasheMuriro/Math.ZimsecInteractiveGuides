        title: "Understanding Like Terms",
        content: `**What are Like Terms?**

Like terms are terms in an algebraic expression that have the *same variable* raised to the *same power*. Think of them as items that belong to the same category, so you can combine them.

**Examples:**
- **Like Terms:** $3x$ and $5x$ (both have $x$ to the power of 1)
- **Like Terms:** $2x^2$ and $-7x^2$ (both have $x^2$)
- **Not Like Terms:** $3x$ and $4x^2$ (different powers of $x$)
- **Not Like Terms:** $5x$ and $5y$ (different variables)

**Why it Matters:**
You can only add or subtract like terms because they represent the same kind of quantity. It‚Äôs like adding apples to apples, not apples to oranges!

**Practice Example:**
Which of these are like terms? $4x$, $2y$, $6x$, $-3x^2$
- Answer: $4x$ and $6x$ are like terms (both have $x$ to the power of 1). $2y$ and $-3x^2$ are not like terms with $4x$ or $6x$ because they involve different variables or powers.`,

        title: "Adding and Subtracting Like Terms",
        content: `**How to Add and Subtract Like Terms**

To simplify an expression, combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables). The variable part stays the same.

**Steps for Adding/Subtracting:**
1. **Identify like terms** in the expression.
2. **Add or subtract the coefficients** of the like terms.
3. **Keep the variable part unchanged**.
4. **Write the simplified expression**.

**Example 1: Adding Like Terms**
Simplify $3x + 5x$
- Step 1: Both $3x$ and $5x$ are like terms (same variable, $x$, same power, 1).
- Step 2: Add the coefficients: $3 + 5 = 8$.
- Step 3: Keep the variable: $x$.
- Step 4: Result: $8x$.

**Example 2: Subtracting Like Terms**
Simplify $7x^2 - 2x^2$
- Step 1: Both $7x^2$ and $2x^2$ are like terms (same variable $x$, same power 2).
- Step 2: Subtract the coefficients: $7 - 2 = 5$.
- Step 3: Keep the variable: $x^2$.
- Step 4: Result: $5x^2$.

**Example 3: Mixed Terms**
Simplify $4x + 3y - 2x + y$
- Step 1: Identify like terms:
  - $x$ terms: $4x$ and $-2x$
  - $y$ terms: $3y$ and $y$ (note: $y$ is the same as $1y$)
- Step 2: Combine $x$ terms: $4x - 2x = 2x$.
- Step 3: Combine $y$ terms: $3y + 1y = 4y$.
- Step 4: Write the result: $2x + 4y$.

**Tips:**
- Always group terms with the same variable and power together before combining.
- Double-check by writing down each step to avoid mistakes.
- Think of coefficients as the number of items (like 3 apples + 5 apples = 8 apples).

**Practice Example:**
Simplify $6a + 2b - 3a + 4b$
- Answer: Combine $a$ terms: $6a - 3a = 3a$. Combine $b$ terms: $2b + 4b = 6b$. Result: $3a + 6b$`,

        title: "Multiplying Algebraic Terms",
        content: `**Multiplying Terms**

When multiplying algebraic terms, you multiply the coefficients and combine the variables by adding their exponents (if the variables are the same).

**Steps for Multiplication:**
1. **Multiply the coefficients** (the numbers in front).
2. **Identify the variables** and their powers.
3. **Add the exponents** of like variables.
4. **Write the simplified term**.

**Example 1: Simple Multiplication**
Simplify $3x \\times 4x$
- Step 1: Multiply coefficients: $3 \\times 4 = 12$.
- Step 2: Variables are both $x$. Add exponents: $x^1 \\times x^1 = x^{1+1} = x^2$.
- Step 3: Result: $12x^2$.

**Example 2: Higher Powers**
Simplify $2x^2 \\times 5x^3$
- Step 1: Multiply coefficients: $2 \\times 5 = 10$.
- Step 2: Variables are both $x$. Add exponents: $x^2 \\times x^3 = x^{2+3} = x^5$.

- Step 3: Combine $y$ variables: $y^1 \\times y^1 = y^{1+1} = y^2$.
- Step 4: Result: $6x^3y^2$.

**Tips:**
- Break it down: first handle the numbers, then each variable one by one.
- Write out the exponents clearly to avoid confusion.
- Practice with small numbers first, then try bigger ones.

**Practice Example:**
Simplify $4a^2 \\times 3a$

- Step 3: Divide $b$ variables: $b^2 \\div b^1 = b^{2-1} = b^1$.
- Step 4: Result: $5a^2b$.

**Tips:**
- Always divide the numbers first to keep it simple.
- Handle each variable separately to avoid mistakes.
- Remember: $y^0 = 1$, so if exponents cancel out, you get 1 for that variable.

**Practice Example:**
Simplify $\\frac{18m^5}{6m^2}$

- Step 4: Multiply: $18 - 6$.
- Step 5: Subtract: $18 - 6 = 12$.
- Step 6: Result: $12$.

**Example 3: Multiple Terms**
Evaluate $x^2 - 2xy + y^2$ when $x = 2$ and $y = 1$
- Step 1: Replace: $(2)^2 - 2(2)(1) + (1)^2$.

A linear equation is an equation where the variable has a power of 1 (e.g., $3x + 5 = 11$). Solving it means finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

**Why it Matters:**
Linear equations are used to model simple relationships, like calculating costs or distances.

**Steps to Solve a Linear Equation:**
1. **Simplify both sides** by combining like terms or clearing fractions.
2. **Isolate the variable** by moving all terms with the variable to one side and constants to the other.
3. **Solve for the variable** by dividing or multiplying.
4. **Check your answer** by substituting it back into the original equation.

**Example 1: Simple Linear Equation**
Solve $2x + 3 = 7$
- Step 1: Equation is already simplified.
- Step 2: Isolate $x$: Subtract 3 from both sides: $2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3$, so $2x = 4$.
- Step 3: Solve: Divide both sides by 2: $2x \\div 2 = 4 \\div 2$, so $x = 2$.

- Step 3: Solve: Divide by 6: $6x \\div 6 = 18 \\div 6$, so $x = 3$.
- Step 4: Check: $3(2(3) - 1) = 3(6 - 1) = 3(5) = 15$ ‚úì.

**Example 3: Fractions**
Solve $\\frac{x}{2} + 4 = 7$
- Step 1: Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2: $2 \\times \\frac{x}{2} + 2 \\times 4 = 2 \\times 7$, so $x + 8 = 14$.
- Step 2: Isolate $x$: Subtract 8: $x + 8 - 8 = 14 - 8$, so $x = 6$.

**Method 2: Completing the Square**
Rewrite the quadratic as a perfect square.

**Steps:**
1. **Isolate $x^2 + bx$**.
2. **Complete the square** by adding $(\\frac{b}{2})^2$.
3. **Solve** by taking the square root.
4. **Check** solutions.

**Example 2: Completing the Square**
Solve $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$
- Step 1: Move constant: $x^2 + 4x = 5$.
- Step 2: Half of 4 is 2, $2^2 = 4$. Add 4: $x^2 + 4x + 4 = 5 + 4$, so $(x + 2)^2 = 9$.
- Step 3: Square root: $x + 2 = \\pm 3$. Solve: $x = 1$ or $x = -5$.
- Step 4: Check: For $x = 1$: $1^2 + 4(1) - 5 = 1 + 4 - 5 = 0$ ‚úì. For $x = -5$: $(-5)^2 + 4(-5) - 5 = 25 - 20 - 5 = 0$ ‚úì.

**Method 3: Quadratic Formula**
Use $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ for $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

**Steps:**
1. **Identify $a$, $b$, $c$**.
2. **Plug into the formula**.
3. **Simplify** the expression.
4. **Check** solutions.

**Example 3: Quadratic Formula**
Solve $2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0$
- Step 1: $a = 2$, $b = -4$, $c = -6$.
- Step 2: Formula: $x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)}$.
- Step 3: Simplify: $x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 48}}{4} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{4} = \\frac{4 \\pm 8}{4}$. So, $x = \\frac{12}{4} = 3$ or $x = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1$.
- Step 4: Check: For $x = 3$: $2(3^2) - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0$ ‚úì. For $x = -1$: $2(-1^2) - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0$ ‚úì.

**Tips:**
- Try factoring first if the numbers are simple.
- Use the quadratic formula when factoring is hard‚Äîit always works!

A linear inequality looks like a linear equation but uses symbols like $<$, $>$, $‚â§$, or $‚â•$ instead of $=$. For example, $2x + 3 < 7$ means finding all $x$ values that make the statement true.

**Why it Matters:**
Inequalities help solve real-world problems, like budgeting (spending less than a certain amount) or determining valid ranges.

**Steps to Solve a Linear Inequality:**
1. **Simplify both sides** by combining like terms or clearing fractions.
2. **Isolate the variable** using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
3. **Important: If you multiply or divide by a negative number, flip the inequality sign.**
4. **Write the solution** as a range (e.g., $x < 2$).
5. **Check** by testing a value in the solution range.
6. **Graph** the solution on a number line: open circle for $<, >$; closed circle for $‚â§, ‚â•$.

**Example 1: Simple Inequality**
Solve $3x + 5 < 14$
- Step 1: Simplify: Subtract 5 from both sides: $3x + 5 - 5 < 14 - 5$, so $3x < 9$.
- Step 2: Isolate $x$: Divide by 3: $3x \\div 3 < 9 \\div 3$, so $x < 3$.
- Step 3: No negative numbers, so no flip needed.
- Step 4: Solution: $x < 3$.
- Step 5: Check: Test $x = 2$: $3(2) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 < 14$ ‚úì.
- Step 6: Graph: Open circle at 3, arrow pointing left.

**Example 2: Negative Coefficient**
Solve $-2x + 4 > 10$
- Step 1: Subtract 4: $-2x + 4 - 4 > 10 - 4$, so $-2x > 6$.
- Step 2: Divide by -2 (flip the sign!): $-2x \\div -2 < 6 \\div -2$, so $x < -3$.
- Step 3: Solution: $x < -3$.
- Step 4: Check: Test $x = -4$: $-2(-4) + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 > 10$ ‚úì.
- Step 5: Graph: Open circle at -3, arrow left.

**Example 3: Fractions**
Solve $\\frac{x}{3} - 2 ‚â§ 1$
- Step 1: Clear fraction: Multiply by 3: $3 \\times \\frac{x}{3} - 3 \\times 2 ‚â§ 3 \\times 1$, so $x - 6 ‚â§ 3$.
- Step 2: Add 6: $x - 6 + 6 ‚â§ 3 + 6$, so $x ‚â§ 9$.
- Step 3: Solution: $x ‚â§ 9$.
- Step 4: Check: Test $x = 6$: $\\frac{6}{3} - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0 ‚â§ 1$ ‚úì.
- Step 5: Graph: Closed circle at 9, arrow left.

**Tips:**
- Treat inequalities like equations, but watch for negative numbers when dividing or multiplying.
- Always test a value to confirm your solution works.
- Draw the number line step-by-step to visualize the solution range.

**Practice Example:**
Solve $4x - 3 ‚â• 9$
- Answer: Add 3: $4x ‚â• 12$. Divide by 4: $x ‚â• 3$. Check: Test $x = 3$: $4(3) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9 ‚â• 9$ ‚úì. Graph: Closed circle at 3, arrow right.`,

        title: "Solving Quadratic Inequalities",
        content: `**What are Quadratic Inequalities?**

A quadratic inequality involves a quadratic expression, like $x^2 - 4x + 3 > 0$. The solution is a range of $x$ values that make the inequality true, often found by factoring and testing regions.

**Why it Matters:**
Quadratic inequalities model situations with curved relationships, like finding when a projectile is above a certain height.

**Steps to Solve a Quadratic Inequality:**
1. **Move all terms to one side** to get zero on the other (e.g., $ax^2 + bx + c > 0$).
2. **Factor the quadratic** to find the roots (where it equals zero).
3. **Plot the roots** on a number line to divide it into intervals.
4. **Test a point in each interval** to see where the inequality holds.
5. **Write the solution** including or excluding the roots (open/closed intervals).
6. **Check** by testing values in the solution range.

**Example 1: Greater Than Zero**
Solve $x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0$
- Step 1: Already in form: $x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0$.
- Step 2: Factor: Numbers for $6$ and $-5$: $-2 \\times -3 = 6$, $-2 - 3 = -5$. So, $(x - 2)(x - 3) > 0$.
- Step 3: Roots: $x = 2$, $x = 3$. Plot on number line: intervals $(-\\infty, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, \\infty)$.
- Step 4: Test points:
  - At $x = 1$: $(1 - 2)(1 - 3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0$ (true).
  - At $x = 2.5$: $(2.5 - 2)(2.5 - 3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0$ (false).
  - At $x = 4$: $(4 - 2)(4 - 3) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0$ (true).
- Step 5: Solution: $(x - 2)(x - 3) > 0$ when $x < 2$ or $x > 3$ (open intervals since inequality is strict).
- Step 6: Check: Test $x = 4$: $4^2 - 5(4) + 6 = 16 - 20 + 6 = 2 > 0$ ‚úì.

**Example 2: Less Than or Equal to Zero**
Solve $x^2 - 4 ‚â§ 0$
- Step 1: Form: $x^2 - 4 ‚â§ 0$.
- Step 2: Factor: Difference of squares: $(x - 2)(x + 2) ‚â§ 0$.
- Step 3: Roots: $x = 2$, $x = -2$. Intervals: $(-\\infty, -2)$, $(-2, 2)$, $(2, \\infty)$.
- Step 4: Test points:
  - At $x = -3$: $(-3 - 2)(-3 + 2) = (-5)(-1) = 5 > 0$ (false).
  - At $x = 0$: $(0 - 2)(0 + 2) = (-2)(2) = -4 ‚â§ 0$ (true).
  - At $x = 3$: $(3 - 2)(3 + 2) = (1)(5) = 5 > 0$ (false).
- Step 5: Solution: $(x - 2)(x + 2) ‚â§ 0$ when $-2 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 2$ (closed since $‚â§$ includes roots).
- Step 6: Check: Test $x = 0$: $0^2 - 4 = -4 ‚â§ 0$ ‚úì.

**Example 3: Complex Quadratic**
Solve $2x^2 + 3x - 2 < 0$
- Step 1: Form: $2x^2 + 3x - 2 < 0$.
- Step 2: Factor: $a \\times c = 2 \\times -2 = -4$, numbers for $-4$ and $3$: $4, -1$. Split: $2x^2 + 4x - x - 2 = 2x(x + 2) - 1(x + 2) = (2x - 1)(x + 2) < 0$.
- Step 3: Roots: $2x - 1 = 0$, $x = \\frac{1}{2}$; $x + 2 = 0$, $x = -2$. Intervals: $(-\\infty, -2)$, $(-2, \\frac{1}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty)$.
- Step 4: Test points:
  - At $x = -3$: $(2(-3) - 1)(-3 + 2) = (-7)(-1) = 7 > 0$ (false).
  - At $x = -1$: $(2(-1) - 1)(-1 + 2) = (-3)(1) = -3 < 0$ (true).
  - At $x = 1$: $(2(1) - 1)(1 + 2) = (1)(3) = 3 > 0$ (false).
- Step 5: Solution: $-2 < x < \\frac{1}{2}$ (open since strict inequality).
- Step 6: Check: Test $x = 0$: $2(0^2) + 3(0) - 2 = -2 < 0$ ‚úì.

**Tips:**
- Draw the number line and mark roots clearly to see the intervals.
- Test one point at a time and write down whether the product is positive or negative.
- Practice factoring first to make finding roots easier.

**Practice Example:**
Solve $x^2 - x - 6 < 0$
- Answer: Factor: Numbers for $-6$ and $-1$: $-3 \\times 2 = -6$, $-3 + 2 = -1$. So, $(x - 3)(x + 2) < 0$. Roots: $x = 3$, $x = -2$. Test: At $x = -3$: $(-3 - 3)(-3 + 2) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0$. At $x = 0$: $(0 - 3)(0 + 2) = (-3)(2) = -6 < 0$. At $x = 4$: $(4 - 3)(4 + 2) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0$. Solution: $-2 < x < 3$. Check: $x = 0$: $0^2 - 0 - 6 = -6 < 0$ ‚úì.`,

        title: "Graphical Representation of Inequalities",
        content: `**What is Graphical Representation?**

Graphing inequalities shows the solution as a region on a number line (for linear) or a coordinate plane (for quadratic). It helps visualize the range of valid values.

**Why it Matters:**
Graphs make it easier to understand solutions, especially for quadratic inequalities or systems of inequalities.

**Steps for Linear Inequalities (Number Line):**
1. **Solve the inequality** to find the boundary point.
2. **Draw a number line** and mark the boundary.
3. **Use an open circle** for $<, >$ or **closed circle** for $‚â§, ‚â•$.
4. **Shade the direction** of the solution (left for $<, ‚â§$; right for $>, ‚â•$).

**Example 1: Linear Inequality**
Graph $2x - 1 < 5$
- Step 1: Solve: $2x < 6$, $x < 3$.
- Step 2: Draw number line, mark 3.
- Step 3: Open circle at 3 (since $<$).
- Step 4: Shade left of 3.

**Steps for Quadratic Inequalities (Coordinate Plane):**
1. **Solve the quadratic** to find roots.
2. **Sketch the parabola** by finding the vertex and roots.
3. **Shade the region** where the inequality holds (above/below the parabola).
4. **Use dashed line** for $<, >$ or **solid line** for $‚â§, ‚â•$.

**Example 2: Quadratic Inequality**
Graph $x^2 - 4x + 3 ‚â§ 0$
- Step 1: Solve: $(x - 1)(x - 3) ‚â§ 0$. Roots: $x = 1$, $x = 3$. Test: Solution is $1 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 3$.
- Step 2: Vertex: $x = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$. At $x = 2$: $2^2 - 4(2) + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1$. Vertex: $(2, -1)$.
- Step 3: Sketch parabola opening upward, crossing $x$-axis at 1 and 3.
- Step 4: Shade between $x = 1$ and $x = 3$, including roots (solid line for $‚â§$).

**Tips:**
- Practice drawing number lines for linear inequalities first‚Äîthey‚Äôre simpler.
- For quadratics, sketch the parabola step-by-step: roots, vertex, then shape.
- Test points on the graph to confirm the shaded region.

**Practice Example:**
Graph $x + 2 > 1$
- Answer: Solve: $x > -1$. Number line: Open circle at -1, shade right. Check: Test $x = 0$: $0 + 2 = 2 > 1$ ‚úì.`,

    content: `Indices (also called exponents) tell you how many times to multiply a number by itself, like a shortcut for repeated multiplication. Logarithms are the opposite‚Äîthey help you find the exponent needed to produce a certain number. Think of indices as building a tower by stacking blocks, and logarithms as figuring out how many blocks were used. This section covers the rules of indices, solving exponential equations, and using logarithms to solve equations.`,

        title: "Laws of Indices",
        content: `**What are Indices?**

An index (or exponent) shows how many times a base is multiplied by itself. For example, $2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$. The laws of indices help simplify expressions with exponents.

**Why it Matters:**
These laws make it easier to work with large numbers or variables in algebra, like in science or finance.

**Laws of Indices:**
1. **Multiplication**: $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$ (add exponents when bases are the same).
2. **Division**: $a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n}$ (subtract exponents when bases are the same).
3. **Power of a Power**: $(a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}$ (multiply exponents).
4. **Zero Exponent**: $a^0 = 1$ (any non-zero base to the power 0 is 1).
5. **Negative Exponent**: $a^{-n} = \\frac{1}{a^n}$ (move to denominator and make positive).
6. **Fractional Exponent**: $a^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]{a}$, $a^{m/n} = (\\sqrt[n]{a})^m$ (represents roots).

**Steps to Simplify Using Laws:**
1. **Identify the base** and exponents.
2. **Apply the relevant law** based on the operation.
3. **Simplify** the expression.
4. **Check** by calculating with numbers if needed.

**Example 1: Multiplication**
Simplify $3^2 \\times 3^4$
- Step 1: Base is 3, exponents are 2 and 4.
- Step 2: Use multiplication law: $3^2 \\times 3^4 = 3^{2+4} = 3^6$.
- Step 3: Simplify: $3^6 = 729$.
- Step 4: Check: $3^2 = 9$, $3^4 = 81$, $9 \\times 81 = 729$ ‚úì.

**Example 2: Division and Negative Exponent**
Simplify $\\frac{5^7}{5^3} \\times 5^{-2}$
- Step 1: Base is 5, exponents are 7, 3, and -2.
- Step 2: Division: $5^7 \\div 5^3 = 5^{7-3} = 5^4$. Then multiply: $5^4 \\times 5^{-2} = 5^{4-2} = 5^2$.
- Step 3: Simplify: $5^2 = 25$.
- Step 4: Check: $\\frac{5^7}{5^3} = 5^4 = 625$, $5^{-2} = \\frac{1}{25}$, $625 \\times \\frac{1}{25} = 25$ ‚úì.

**Example 3: Power of a Power and Fractional Exponent**
Simplify $(2^3)^{1/2}$
- Step 1: Base is 2, exponents are 3 and $1/2$.
- Step 2: Power law: $(2^3)^{1/2} = 2^{3 \\times 1/2} = 2^{3/2}$.
- Step 3: Fractional exponent: $2^{3/2} = (2^{1/2})^3 = (\\sqrt{2})^3$.
- Step 4: Check: $2^3 = 8$, $8^{1/2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828$. Also, $(\\sqrt{2})^3 \\approx (1.414)^3 \\approx 2.828$ ‚úì.

**Tips:**
- Memorize one law at a time and practice with numbers (e.g., $2^2 \\times 2^3$).
- Write out each step to avoid mixing up exponents.
- Use a calculator to verify results for confidence.

**Practice Example:**
Simplify $\\frac{4^5}{4^2} \\times 4^{-1}$

These are equations where the variable is in the exponent, like $2^x = 8$. You solve by making the bases the same or using logarithms (covered later).

**Why it Matters:**
Exponential equations model growth or decay, like population growth or radioactive decay.

**Steps to Solve (Same Base Method):**
1. **Rewrite both sides** with the same base if possible.
2. **Equate the exponents** since if $a^m = a^n$, then $m = n$.
3. **Solve the resulting equation**.
4. **Check** by substituting back.

**Example 1: Same Base**
Solve $3^x = 27$
- Step 1: Rewrite: $27 = 3^3$, so $3^x = 3^3$.
- Step 2: Equate exponents: $x = 3$.
- Step 3: Check: $3^3 = 27$ ‚úì.

**Example 2: Different Bases**
Solve $4^x = 16$
- Step 1: Rewrite: $4 = 2^2$, $16 = 2^4$, so $(2^2)^x = 2^4$. Simplify: $2^{2x} = 2^4$.
- Step 2: Equate: $2x = 4$, so $x = 2$.
- Step 3: Check: $4^2 = 16$ ‚úì.

**Example 3: Negative Exponent**
Solve $5^{x-1} = \\frac{1}{25}$
- Step 1: Rewrite: $\\frac{1}{25} = 25^{-1} = (5^2)^{-1} = 5^{-2}$. So, $5^{x-1} = 5^{-2}$.
- Step 2: Equate: $x - 1 = -2$, so $x = -1$.
- Step 3: Check: $5^{-1-1} = 5^{-2} = \\frac{1}{25}$ ‚úì.

**Tips:**
- Practice rewriting numbers as powers (e.g., $8 = 2^3$, $9 = 3^2$).
- Write down each step to keep track of bases and exponents.
- If bases don‚Äôt match easily, try small numbers for $x$ to guess and check.

        content: `**What are Logarithms?**

A logarithm answers, "What exponent gives this result?" For example, $\\log_2(8) = 3$ because $2^3 = 8$. Logarithms are the inverse of exponents.

**Why it Matters:**
Logs help solve exponential equations and are used in fields like science (e.g., pH scales) and computing.

**Key Logarithm Properties:**
1. **Definition**: $\\log_b(a) = c$ means $b^c = a$.
2. **Product Rule**: $\\log_b(mn) = \\log_b(m) + \\log_b(n)$.
3. **Quotient Rule**: $\\log_b(\\frac{m}{n}) = \\log_b(m) - \\log_b(n)$.
4. **Power Rule**: $\\log_b(m^n) = n \\log_b(m)$.
5. **Change of Base**: $\\log_b(a) = \\frac{\\log_k(a)}{\\log_k(b)}$ (useful with calculators, often $k = 10$ or $e$).
6. **Special Logs**: $\\log_b(1) = 0$, $\\log_b(b) = 1$.

**Steps to Evaluate Logarithms:**
1. **Rewrite as an exponential** equation.
2. **Solve for the exponent**.
3. **Use properties** to simplify if needed.
4. **Check** by converting back.

**Example 1: Basic Log**
Evaluate $\\log_3(9)$
- Step 1: Rewrite: $\\log_3(9) = x$ means $3^x = 9$.
- Step 2: Since $9 = 3^2$, $3^x = 3^2$, so $x = 2$.
- Step 3: Check: $3^2 = 9$ ‚úì.

**Example 2: Using Properties**
Simplify $\\log_2(4) + \\log_2(8)$
- Step 1: Product rule: $\\log_2(4 \\times 8) = \\log_2(32)$.
- Step 2: Evaluate: $32 = 2^5$, so $\\log_2(32) = 5$.
- Step 3: Check: $\\log_2(4) = 2$ ($2^2 = 4$), $\\log_2(8) = 3$ ($2^3 = 8$), $2 + 3 = 5$ ‚úì.

**Example 3: Power Rule**
Simplify $2 \\log_5(3)$
- Step 1: Power rule: $2 \\log_5(3) = \\log_5(3^2) = \\log_5(9)$.
- Step 2: Cannot simplify further without a calculator.
- Step 3: Check: $3^2 = 9$, so $\\log_5(9)$ is correct form.

**Tips:**
- Think of logs as "undoing" exponents.
- Practice converting logs to exponential form to understand the relationship.
- Memorize properties one at a time with simple examples.

**Practice Example:**

These are equations where the variable is inside a logarithm, like $\\log_2(x) = 3$. You solve by converting to exponential form or using log properties.

**Why it Matters:**
Log equations appear in problems involving exponential growth or decay, like interest calculations.

**Steps to Solve:**
1. **Isolate the logarithm** if possible.
2. **Convert to exponential form** or combine logs using properties.
3. **Solve the resulting equation**.
4. **Check** for valid solutions (logs are undefined for non-positive arguments).

**Example 1: Simple Log Equation**
Solve $\\log_3(x) = 2$

- Step 2: Exponential form: $3^2 = x$, so $x = 9$.
- Step 3: Check: $\\log_3(9) = 2$ ($3^2 = 9$) ‚úì.

**Example 2: Using Properties**
Solve $\\log_2(x) + \\log_2(x - 1) = 1$
- Step 1: Product rule: $\\log_2(x(x - 1)) = 1$.
- Step 2: Exponential form: $2^1 = x(x - 1)$, so $x^2 - x = 2$.
- Step 3: Solve: $x^2 - x - 2 = 0$, factor: $(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -1$.
- Step 4: Check: For $x = 2$: $\\log_2(2) + \\log_2(1) = 1 + 0 = 1$ ‚úì. For $x = -1$: $\\log_2(-1)$ is undefined, so reject.
- Step 5: Solution: $x = 2$.

**Example 3: Quotient Rule**
Solve $\\log_5(2x) - \\log_5(x - 1) = 1$
- Step 1: Quotient rule: $\\log_5(\\frac{2x}{x - 1}) = 1$.
- Step 2: Exponential form: $5^1 = \\frac{2x}{x - 1}$, so $2x = 5(x - 1)$.
- Step 3: Solve: $2x = 5x - 5$, $5 = 3x$, $x = \\frac{5}{3}$.
- Step 4: Check: $\\log_5(2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{3}) - \\log_5(\\frac{5}{3} - 1) = \\log_5(\\frac{10}{3}) - \\log_5(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\log_5(\\frac{10/3}{2/3}) = \\log_5(5) = 1$ ‚úì.

**Tips:**
- Always convert logs to exponential form to make solving easier.
- Check for undefined logs ($x > 0$ inside logs).
- Practice with simple logs before combining with properties.

**Practice Example:**
Solve $\\log_4(x + 3) = 2$
