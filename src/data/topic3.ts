Foundation of financial mathematics covering everyday calculations:

**Basic Concepts:**
- Cost Price (CP): Original price paid for an item
- Selling Price (SP): Price at which item is sold
- Marked Price (MP): Listed price before discounts
- Discount: Reduction from marked price

**Key Formulas:**
- Discount = Marked Price - Selling Price
- Discount% = $\\frac{\\text{Discount}}{\\text{Marked Price}} \\times 100\\%$
- Final Price = Marked Price - Discount

**Data Interpretation:**
- Reading and interpreting bills, receipts, and price lists
- Extracting relevant data for calculations
- Understanding different pricing structures

**Example:**
A shirt marked at $50 has a 20% discount:
- Discount = $50 \\times 0.20 = $10
- Final Price = $50 - $10 = $40`,

        title: "Profit and Loss Calculations",
        content: `**PROFIT AND LOSS (Forms 1-3)**

Essential business calculations for buying and selling:

**Key Terms:**
- Cost Price (CP): Price paid to acquire goods
- Selling Price (SP): Price at which goods are sold
- Profit: When SP > CP
- Loss: When CP > SP
- Overhead expenses: Additional costs (transport, storage)

**Basic Formulas:**
- Profit = SP - CP
- Loss = CP - SP
- Profit% = $\\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{CP}} \\times 100\\%$
- Loss% = $\\frac{\\text{Loss}}{\\text{CP}} \\times 100\\%$

**Advanced Calculations:**
- Finding SP when CP and profit% are given: SP = CP(1 + profit%/100)
- Finding CP when SP and profit% are given: CP = $\\frac{SP}{1 + profit\\%/100}$
- Including overhead expenses in calculations

**Business Applications:**
- Retail margin calculations
- Wholesale vs retail pricing
- Bulk purchase advantages
- Seasonal pricing strategies

**Example:**
Article bought for $80, sold for $100:
- Profit = $100 - $80 = $20
- Profit% = $\\frac{20}{80} \\times 100\\% = 25\\%$`,

      },
      {
        title: "Simple and Compound Interest",
        content: `**SIMPLE INTEREST (Form 3)**

Interest calculated only on the principal amount:

**Formula:**
$I = \\frac{PRT}{100}$

Where:
- I = Interest earned
- P = Principal (initial amount)
- R = Rate of interest per year
- T = Time in years

**Amount Formula:**
$A = P + I = P + \\frac{PRT}{100} = P(1 + \\frac{RT}{100})$

**COMPOUND INTEREST (Form 4)**

Interest calculated on principal plus accumulated interest:

**Annual Compounding:**
$A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{100})^t$

**Different Compounding Periods:**
- Semi-annually: $A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{200})^{2t}$
- Quarterly: $A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{400})^{4t}$
- Monthly: $A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{1200})^{12t}$

**Comparison:**
- Compound interest grows exponentially
- Simple interest grows linearly
- Difference becomes significant over time

**Applications:**
- Bank savings accounts, fixed deposits
- Investment planning, loan calculations

**Example:**
$1000 at 8% compounded annually for 2 years:
$A = 1000(1.08)^2 = $1166.40$`,

        title: "Hire Purchase and Commission",

System of buying goods through installments:

**Key Components:**
- Cash Price: Full price if paid immediately
- Down Payment: Initial payment made
- Monthly Installments: Regular payments
- Total HP Price: Down payment + all installments

**Calculations:**
- Total HP Price = Down Payment + (Monthly Payment √ó Number of months)
- Extra amount paid = Total HP Price - Cash Price
- HP Interest Rate = $\\frac{\\text{Extra Amount}}{\\text{Cash Price}} \\times 100\\%$

**COMMISSION (Form 4)**

Payment based on sales performance:

**Types of Commission:**
- Flat Rate: Fixed percentage of sales
- Graduated/Tiered: Different rates for different levels
- Salary + Commission: Base salary plus commission

**Calculations:**
- Basic Commission = Sales √ó Commission Rate
- Graduated Commission: Different rates for different sales levels

**Example:**
TV costs $800 cash or $200 down + $55/month for 12 months:
- Total HP = $200 + ($55 √ó 12) = $860
- Extra paid = $860 - $800 = $60
- Interest = $\\frac{60}{800} \\times 100\\% = 7.5\\%$`,

Converting between different currencies:

**Key Concepts:**
- Exchange Rate: Price of one currency in terms of another
- Base Currency: Currency being converted from
- Quote Currency: Currency being converted to
- Buying Rate: Rate at which bank buys foreign currency
- Selling Rate: Rate at which bank sells foreign currency

**Conversion Formula:**
Amount in Quote Currency = Amount in Base Currency √ó Exchange Rate

**Practical Applications:**
- International travel and tourism
- Import/export business
- Online shopping from foreign countries
- Investment in foreign markets
- Remittances and money transfers

**Bank Charges:**
- Commission on currency exchange
- Service fees
- Spread between buying and selling rates

**Cross Rate Calculations:**
When direct exchange rate not available, calculate via intermediary currency

**Example:**
Convert $100 USD to ZWL at rate 1 USD = 350 ZWL:
Amount in ZWL = $100 √ó 350 = 35,000 ZWL`,

Understanding various tax systems and calculations:

**VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT):**
- Tax on goods and services
- VAT = Price √ó VAT Rate
- Total Cost = Price + VAT
- VAT-inclusive vs VAT-exclusive pricing

**INCOME TAX (PAY AS YOU EARN - PAYE):**
- Progressive tax system with different brackets
- Tax-free threshold and allowances
- Deducted at source from salary

**PAYE Calculation Example:**
Tax Brackets:
- First $300: 0%
- Next $200: 10%  
- Above $500: 25%

**CUSTOMS AND EXCISE DUTY:**
- Tax on imported goods
- Based on value or quantity
- Duty = Value √ó Duty Rate
- VAT calculated on duty-inclusive value

**Comprehensive Example:**
Imported car value $10,000, duty 30%, VAT 15%:
- Duty = $10,000 √ó 0.30 = $3,000
- Duty-inclusive value = $13,000
- VAT = $13,000 √ó 0.15 = $1,950
- Total cost = $14,950

- Import cost calculations
- Business expense planning
- Personal tax planning`,
