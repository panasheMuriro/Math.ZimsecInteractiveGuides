        title: "Pythagoras Theorem",
        content: `**PYTHAGORAS THEOREM**

**Formula:**
- For a right-angled triangle with sides $a$, $b$ (legs) and $c$ (hypotenuse):
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

\`\`\`pythagoras-demo-1
\`\`\`


**Derivation:**
- Use geometric methods (e.g., counting squares on a grid) to show $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
- Example: Divide a square into two squares and two rectangles to demonstrate.


**Applications:**
- Find the length of an unknown side (e.g., diagonal of a rectangle, height of a ladder).
- Real-world problems: Calculate distances in construction, navigation, or surveying.

**Examples:**
- If $a = 3$, $b = 4$, find $c$: $c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$, so $c = 5$.
- If $c = 10$, $a = 6$, find $b$: $b^2 = 10^2 - 6^2 = 100 - 36 = 64$, so $b = 8$.

**Syllabus Objectives**:
- Derive the Pythagoras theorem using geometric methods (e.g., counting squares).

        title: "Pythagorean Triples",
        content: `**PYTHAGOREAN TRIPLES**

**Definition:**
- A set of three positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
- Examples: $(3, 4, 5)$, $(5, 12, 13)$, $(7, 24, 25)$.

**Verification:**
- Check if $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ holds.
- Example: For $(3, 4, 5)$, $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$ (Pythagorean).
- Non-example: For $(2, 3, 4)$, $2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13 \neq 16 = 4^2$ (not Pythagorean).

**Generating Triples:**
- Use formula: For integers $m > n > 0$, $a = m^2 - n^2$, $b = 2mn$, $c = m^2 + n^2$.
- Example: $m = 2$, $n = 1$: $a = 4 - 1 = 3$, $b = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 4$, $c = 4 + 1 = 5$ ‚Üí $(3, 4, 5)$.

**Applications:**
- Identify triples in geometric problems or designs.
- Model real-life phenomena (e.g., dimensions of right-angled structures).

**Syllabus Objectives**:
- Show whether given triples are Pythagorean by verifying $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
- Solve problems involving Pythagorean triples in real-world contexts.
