**Steps for Measuring:**
1. Place the center point of the protractor on the vertex of the angle
2. Align one arm of the angle with the zero line of the protractor
3. Read the measurement where the second arm crosses the scale
4. Choose the correct scale (inner or outer) based on angle orientation

**Key Tips:**
- Always start from $0¬∞$ on the appropriate scale
- For angles greater than $180¬∞$, measure the reflex angle: $360¬∞ - \\text{acute measure}$
- Ensure the protractor is properly aligned with the vertex

**Common Errors:**
- Reading from wrong scale
- Misaligning the vertex

5. One line on each side of the original

**LOCUS: EQUIDISTANT FROM TWO INTERSECTING LINES**

**Definition:**
The locus of points equidistant from two intersecting lines consists of the two angle bisectors

**Construction:**
1. Bisect each of the four angles formed by intersecting lines
2. Result: Two perpendicular lines through intersection point
3. Each bisector contains points equidistant from the two original lines

**Applications:**
- Road construction (parallel to existing road)
- Property boundaries  
- Navigation channels
- Angle bisector properties in triangles

**Example:**
Find locus of points 3 cm from line $l$
Answer: Two lines parallel to $l$, each 3 cm away on opposite sides`,

        title: "Compound Loci Problems",
        content: `**SOLVING COMPOUND LOCI PROBLEMS**

**Definition:**
Problems requiring points to satisfy two or more locus conditions simultaneously

**Solution Method:**
1. Draw each locus separately
2. Find intersection points/regions
3. Intersection gives final answer

**Common Combinations:**

**Type 1: Two Distance Conditions**
- Distance $r_1$ from point $A$ AND distance $r_2$ from point $B$
- Solution: Intersection of two circles

**Type 2: Distance and Line Conditions** 
- Distance $r$ from point $A$ AND distance $d$ from line $l$
- Solution: Intersection of circle and parallel lines

**Type 3: Angle and Distance Conditions**
- On angle bisector AND distance $r$ from vertex
- Solution: Points on angle bisector at specified distance

**Problem-Solving Steps:**
1. Read conditions carefully
2. Identify each locus type  
3. Construct each locus accurately
4. Mark intersection points clearly
5. Verify solution satisfies all conditions

**Example:**
Find points 4 cm from point $A$ and 3 cm from line $l$
Solution: Intersections of circle (center $A$, radius 4 cm) with two lines parallel to $l$ at distance 3 cm`,

        title: "Line Symmetry (Reflection)",
        content: `**LINE SYMMETRY PROPERTIES**

**Definition:**
A shape has line symmetry if it can be folded along a line so that both halves match exactly

**Line of Symmetry (Mirror Line):**
- Axis along which reflection occurs
- Every point on one side has corresponding point on other side
- Corresponding points are equidistant from mirror line

**Identifying Lines of Symmetry:**
1. Fold test: Can shape be folded to match itself?
2. Mirror test: Does mirror image complete the shape?
3. Perpendicular distances must be equal

**Examples:**

**Regular Polygons:**
- **Equilateral triangle:** 3 lines of symmetry
- **Square:** 4 lines of symmetry  
- **Regular pentagon:** 5 lines of symmetry
- **Regular n-gon:** n lines of symmetry

**Other Shapes:**
- **Rectangle:** 2 lines of symmetry
- **Rhombus:** 2 lines of symmetry
- **Isosceles triangle:** 1 line of symmetry
- **Circle:** Infinite lines of symmetry`,

        title: "Rotational Symmetry",
        content: `**ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY PROPERTIES**

**Definition:**
A shape has rotational symmetry if it looks identical after rotation through an angle less than 360¬∞

**Order of Rotational Symmetry:**
Number of positions where shape looks identical during one complete rotation

**Angle of Rotation:**
$\\text{Angle} = \\frac{360¬∞}{\\text{order of symmetry}}$

**Examples:**

**Regular Polygons:**
- **Equilateral triangle:** Order 3, angle = 120¬∞
- **Square:** Order 4, angle = 90¬∞`,
