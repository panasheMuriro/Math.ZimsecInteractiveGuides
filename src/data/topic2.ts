A collection of distinct objects called elements:
- Represented with curly braces: $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$
- Order doesn't matter: $\\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{3, 2, 1\\}$
- No duplicates: $\\{1, 1, 2\\} = \\{1, 2\\}$

**NOTATION**
- $\\in$ means "is an element of": $2 \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$
- $\\notin$ means "is not an element of": $4 \\notin \\{1, 2, 3\\}$
- $\\emptyset$ or $\\{\\}$ represents the empty set`,

        title: "Types of Sets",
        content: `**TYPES OF SETS**

1. Finite Set: Has countable number of elements
   - Example: $A = \\{a, b, c\\}$

2. Infinite Set: Has unlimited elements
   - Example: $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$

3. Empty Set ($\\emptyset$): Contains no elements

4. Universal Set ($\\mathbb{U}$): All possible elements in context

5. Subset ($A \\subseteq B$): All elements of A are in B
   - Example: $\\{1, 2\\} \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3\\}$

6. Proper Subset ($A \\subset B$): A is subset but $A \\neq B$`,

      {
        title: "Venn Diagrams (Two Subsets)",
        content: `**VENN DIAGRAMS WITH TWO SETS**
Visual representation of sets using overlapping circles:

- Union ($A \\cup B$): All elements in A or B or both
- Intersection ($A \\cap B$): Only elements in both A and B
- Complement ($A'$): Elements not in A (relative to universal set)
- Difference ($A \\setminus B$): Elements in A but not in B

Example:
- Let $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $B = \\{3, 4, 5\\}$
- $A \\cup B = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$
- $A \\cap B = \\{3\\}$
- $A \\setminus B = \\{1, 2\\}$`,

        title: "Set Builder Notation",
        content: `**SET BUILDER NOTATION**
A concise way to define sets using properties:
- $\\{x \\mid x \\text{ has property } P\\}$
- Read as "the set of all x such that x has property P"

Examples:
1. $\\{x \\mid x \\text{ is an even integer}\\}$
2. $\\{x \\mid x > 0 \\text{ and } x < 10\\}$
3. $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x^2 < 4\\}$

This notation is especially useful for infinite sets.`,

        title: "Venn Diagrams (Three Subsets)",
        content: `**VENN DIAGRAMS WITH THREE SETS**
Three overlapping circles representing sets A, B, and C:

Key regions:
1. $A \\cap B \\cap C$: Elements in all three sets
2. $(A \\cap B) \\setminus C$: In A and B but not C
3. $A \\setminus (B \\cup C)$: Only in A
4. And similarly for other combinations

Example operations:
- $A \\cup B \\cup C$: All elements in any set
- $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C)$: Elements in both A and B, or both A and C`,
