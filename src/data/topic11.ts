**Definition:**
- A vector is a quantity with both magnitude (size) and direction.
- Example: A displacement of 5 km east is a vector; 5 km alone (scalar) is not.

**Contrast with Scalars:**
- Scalars have magnitude only (e.g., distance, speed).
- Vectors include direction (e.g., displacement, velocity).

**Applications:**
- Navigation: Representing movement in a specific direction.
- Physics: Describing forces or velocities.

**Syllabus Objectives**:
- Define a vector as a quantity with magnitude and direction.
- Distinguish vectors from scalars in real-world contexts.
- Discuss vector concepts using examples (e.g., displacement).
- Use ICT tools to visualize vector representations.`,

**Forms of Notation:**
- **Arrow Notation:** $\\vec{AB}$ or $\\vec{v}$ (vector from point A to B or named v).
- **Boldface:** $v$ or $AB$ in print.
- **Column Form:** For a vector with components $x$ (horizontal), $y$ (vertical):
  $$\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$$
- Example: A vector moving 3 units right, 4 units up: $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$.

**Representation:**
- On a Cartesian plane, draw an arrow from origin (0,0) to (x,y).
- Example: $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ starts at (0,0), ends at (2,3).

**Syllabus Objectives**:
- Interpret and use vector notation (arrow, column form).
- Express vectors in column form accurately.

        title: "Translation, Negative, Equal, and Parallel Vectors",
        content: `**TYPES OF VECTORS (FORMS 1-2)**

**Translation Vector:**
- Represents movement from one point to another.
- Example: Moving from (1,2) to (3,5): $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-1 \\\\ 5-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.
- Draw as an arrow on the Cartesian plane.

**Negative Vector:**
- Opposite direction, same magnitude.
- For $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$, negative is $-\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} -x \\\\ -y \\end{pmatrix}$.
- Example: If $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$, then $-\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$.

**Equal Vectors:**
- Same magnitude and direction, regardless of starting point.
- Example: $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ at (0,0) equals $\\vec{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ at (3,4).

**Parallel Vectors:**
- Same or opposite direction, magnitudes may differ.
- Example: $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$ is parallel to $\\vec{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ (since $\\vec{v} = 2\\vec{w}$).

**Addition:**
- For vectors $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ y_1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\vec{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\\\ y_2 \\end{pmatrix}$:
  $$\\vec{v} + \\vec{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 + x_2 \\\\ y_1 + y_2 \\end{pmatrix}$$
- Geometrically: Place tail of $\\vec{w}$ at head of $\\vec{v}$, result is vector from tail of $\\vec{v}$ to head of $\\vec{w}$.
- Example: $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}$.

**Subtraction:**
- $\\vec{v} - \\vec{w} = \\vec{v} + (-\\vec{w}) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 - x_2 \\\\ y_1 - y_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.
- Geometrically: Vector from head of $\\vec{w}$ to head of $\\vec{v}$.
- Example: $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.

        title: "Scalar Multiplication and Magnitude",
        content: `**SCALAR MULTIPLICATION AND MAGNITUDE (FORM 3)**

**Scalar Multiplication:**
- For vector $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$ and scalar $k$:
  $$k\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} kx \\\\ ky \\end{pmatrix}$$
- Effect: Scales magnitude by $|k|$, reverses direction if $k < 0$.
- Example: If $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$, $2\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}$, $-\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$.

**Magnitude:**
- For $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$:
  $$|\\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$
- Example: If $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$, $|\\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.

**Applications:**
- Scalar multiplication: Adjust vector lengths (e.g., scaling forces).
- Magnitude: Calculate distances or strengths (e.g., displacement length).

**Syllabus Objectives**:
- Multiply a vector by a scalar accurately.

        title: "Vector Properties of Plane Shapes",
        content: `**VECTOR PROPERTIES OF PLANE SHAPES (FORM 4)**

**Linear Combinations:**
- Express edges/diagonals of plane shapes (e.g., parallelograms, triangles) as linear combinations of vectors.
- Example: In parallelogram $ABCD$, diagonal $\\vec{AC} = \\vec{AB} + \\vec{BC}$.

**Equal Vectors:**
- Find scalars $k$ in equal vectors: If $k\\vec{v} = m\\vec{w}$, solve for $k$, $m$.
- Example: If $\\begin{pmatrix} 2k \\\\ 3k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}$, then $2k = 4$, $3k = 6$, so $k = 2$.

**Ratios of Parallel Edges/Diagonals:**
- For parallel vectors $\\vec{v} = k\\vec{w}$, find ratio $|\\vec{v}| : |\\vec{w}|$.
- Example: If $\\vec{AB} = 2\\vec{CD}$, ratio of lengths is 2:1.

**Applications:**
- Geometry: Analyze properties of shapes (e.g., parallelograms, trapeziums).
- Engineering: Study forces in structural designs.
