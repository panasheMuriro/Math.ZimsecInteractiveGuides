        title: "Definition of Probability",
        content: `**DEFINITION OF PROBABILITY (FORM 1)**

**Definition:**
- Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means impossible and 1 means certain.
- Formula: For an event $ E $ with equally likely outcomes, the probability is:
  $$ P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} $$
- Example: When rolling a fair six-sided die, the probability of rolling a 3 is:
  $$ P(3) = \\frac{1}{6} $$, since there is 1 favorable outcome out of 6 possible outcomes.

**Key Terms:**
- **Experiment:** An action with uncertain outcomes (e.g., flipping a coin).
- **Outcome:** A possible result of an experiment (e.g., heads or tails).
- **Event:** A specific outcome or set of outcomes (e.g., getting heads).
- **Sample Space:** The set of all possible outcomes (e.g., for a coin, $ \\{ \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\} $).

**Applications:**
- Everyday decisions: Predicting weather or game outcomes.
- Statistics: Analyzing data trends.

**Syllabus Objectives**:
- Define probability and key terms (experiment, outcome, event, sample space).
- Calculate the probability of single events using the formula.
- Discuss probability concepts using real-world examples.

        title: "Experimental Probability",
        content: `**EXPERIMENTAL PROBABILITY (FORM 1)**

**Definition:**
- Experimental probability is based on the results of repeated trials of an experiment.
- Formula: For an event $ E $ after $ n $ trials:
  $$ P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times } E \\text{ occurs}}{n} $$
- Example: If a coin is flipped 100 times and lands on heads 45 times, the experimental probability of heads is:
  $$ P(\\text{heads}) = \\frac{45}{100} = 0.45 $$.

**Applications:**
- Quality control: Estimating defect rates in manufacturing.

      content: `**THEORETICAL PROBABILITY PROBLEMS (FORM 2)**

**Step-by-Step Problem Solving:**

**Step 1: Identify the Problem Setup**
- Determine if the problem involves theoretical probability
- Check that all outcomes are equally likely
- Identify the type of experiment (dice, cards, spinners, etc.)
- Note any constraints or special conditions

**Step 2: Define the Sample Space**
- List all possible outcomes of the experiment
- Count the total number of possible outcomes
- Ensure all outcomes are equally likely
- Example: For a standard die, sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, total = 6

**Step 3: Identify the Event of Interest**
- Clearly define what constitutes a "favorable" outcome
- List all outcomes that satisfy the event condition

**Step 5: Simplify and Verify**
- Reduce fractions to lowest terms
- Convert to decimal or percentage if required
- Check that $ 0 \\leq P(E) \\leq 1 $
- Verify the answer makes logical sense

**Common Problem Types:**

**Type 1: Basic Single Event**
- Example: "What is the probability of drawing an ace from a standard deck?"
- Sample space: 52 cards
- Favorable outcomes: 4 aces
- Solution: $P(\\text{ace}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}$

**Type 2: Compound Conditions**
- Example: "What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on a die?"
- Sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Favorable outcomes: {5, 6}
- Solution: $P(>4) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$

**Type 3: Complement Problems**
- Example: "What is the probability of NOT drawing a face card?"
- Face cards: 12 out of 52
- Solution: $P(\\text{not face card}) = 1 - \\frac{12}{52} = \\frac{40}{52} = \\frac{10}{13}$

- Red kings: 2 (king of hearts, king of diamonds)
- Solution: $P(\\text{red king}) = \\frac{2}{52} = \\frac{1}{26}$

**Step-by-Step Example:**

**Problem:** A spinner has 8 equal sections numbered 1 through 8. What is the probability of spinning a prime number?

**Step 1:** Theoretical probability problem with equally likely outcomes
**Step 2:** Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, Total outcomes = 8
**Step 3:** Prime numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}, Favorable outcomes = 4
**Step 4:** $P(\\text{prime}) = \\frac{4}{8}$
**Step 5:** $P(\\text{prime}) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ or 50%

**Key Probability Rules:**

**1. Complement Rule:**
$P(\\text{not } E) = 1 - P(E)$

**2. Probability Range:**
$0 \\leq P(E) \\leq 1$

**3. Certain Event:**
$P(\\text{certain event}) = 1$

**4. Impossible Event:**
$P(\\text{impossible event}) = 0$

**5. Sum of All Probabilities:**
For all possible outcomes: $\\sum P(\\text{outcome}) = 1$

**Advanced Problem-Solving Strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Use Complement When Easier**
- If finding $P(E)$ is complex, calculate $P(\\text{not } E)$ instead
- Then use $P(E) = 1 - P(\\text{not } E)$

**Strategy 2: Break Down Complex Events**
- Identify all sub-conditions that make the event true
- Count systematically to avoid missing cases

**Strategy 3: Verify Using Different Methods**
- Check answer using complement rule
- Ensure all probabilities add to 1 for exhaustive events

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Forgetting to reduce fractions
- Miscounting favorable or total outcomes
- Assuming outcomes are equally likely when they're not
- Confusing "at least" with "exactly" conditions
- Not checking that probability is between 0 and 1

**Real-World Applications:**
