        question: "A bag contains 3 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If one marble is drawn at random, what is the first step in solving this problem?",
        questionType: 'text',

        explanation: "The first step in any probability problem is to understand the setup. This problem involves drawing one item from a collection where each item is equally likely to be chosen, which is the definition of theoretical probability. Recognizing this helps you choose the correct formula and approach."

        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0, // Option 3 is also technically correct for total outcomes, but 0 best describes sample space.
        explanation: "The sample space consists of all possible individual outcomes. While we can group them by color for counting, the fundamental outcomes are drawing each specific marble. There are 3 red + 5 blue + 2 green = 10 marbles in total. So, there are 10 possible outcomes, and they are equally likely."

        correct: 0,
        explanation: "The event of interest is 'drawing a blue marble'. The favorable outcomes are the specific results that satisfy this condition. Since there are 5 blue marbles, there are 5 distinct ways this event can occur (drawing blue marble 1, or 2, ..., or 5). Therefore, there are 5 favorable outcomes."

        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "We substitute the numbers we identified: Number of favorable outcomes (drawing a blue marble) = 5. Total number of possible outcomes (total marbles) = 10. So, $ P(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{5}{10} $. This fraction simplifies to $ \\frac{1}{2} $ or 0.5 or 50%."

        explanation: "A standard deck has 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades), each with 13 cards. So, there are 13 hearts. The total number of cards is 52. Using the probability formula: $ P(\\text{Heart}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of hearts}}{\\text{Total number of cards}} = \\frac{13}{52} $. This simplifies to $ \\frac{1}{4} $."

        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "A good verification step is to ensure that the probabilities of complementary events sum to 1. Here, $ P(\\text{Heart}) + P(\\text{Not Heart}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1 $. This confirms our calculation. Additionally, checking that the probability is between 0 and 1 ($ 0 \\leq 0.75 \\leq 1 $) and that it makes logical sense (it's more likely to draw a non-heart than a heart) supports the correctness of the answer."

A probability of 1.5 is greater than 1, which violates this rule and is therefore impossible. Probabilities of 0, 0.25, and 1 are all valid (representing impossible, unlikely, and certain events, respectively)."

The numbers that are even are {2, 4, 6}. The numbers greater than 2 are {3, 4, 5, 6}. The numbers that are *both* even AND greater than 2 are the intersection of these two sets: {4, 6}. There are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 total outcomes. So, $ P(\\text{even AND } > 2) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} $."
