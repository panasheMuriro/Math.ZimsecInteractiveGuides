        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0,

        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "A standard die has 6 faces, numbered 1 through 6. So, there are 6 possible outcomes when it's rolled. We are interested in the event 'rolling a 5'. There is only one face with the number 5, so there is 1 favorable outcome."

        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Probability describes the long-term likelihood of an event occurring. $ \\frac{1}{6} $ means that if the die is rolled many times, the proportion of times a 5 is rolled should get closer and closer to $ \\frac{1}{6} $. It does not guarantee exactly one 5 in every six rolls."

        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "The formula for experimental probability is $ P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times E occurs}}{\\text{Total number of trials}} $. For the event 'landing on Blue', we need the count of how many times Blue occurred (45) and the total number of spins (100)."

        explanation: "We use the formula $ P(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times Blue occurred}}{\\text{Total number of trials}} = \\frac{45}{100} $. This fraction simplifies to 0.45 (or 45%)."

        ],
        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "A good way to check experimental probability calculations is to ensure that the probabilities of all possible, mutually exclusive outcomes sum to 1 (or 100%). Here: $ P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{30}{100} = 0.30 $, $ P(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{45}{100} = 0.45 $, $ P(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 $. Sum: $ 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.25 = 1.00 $. This confirms the calculations are consistent."

        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Probabilities are always numbers between 0 and 1, inclusive. A probability of 0 means the event is impossible, and a probability of 1 means the event is certain. Any calculated probability outside this range (like 1.5 or -0.2) is definitely incorrect and indicates a mistake in counting outcomes or applying the formula."

        optionType: 'text',
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "A probability of 0.75 is equivalent to 75%. This means the event (rain) is likely to happen, but it's not certain. It quantifies the chance or likelihood, not a guarantee of occurrence or the duration."
