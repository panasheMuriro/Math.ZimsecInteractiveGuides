      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "Continuous data can take any value within a range and is typically measured. Temperature is measured on a continuous scale and can have infinite possible values within a range.",

        "It preserves the exact values of all data points",
        "It makes the mode immediately visible",
        "It provides a more compact representation for large datasets",
        "It eliminates the need for class boundaries"
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: "Grouped data organizes values into class intervals, which creates a more compact representation that's especially useful for large datasets. However, this comes at the cost of losing individual value precision.",

        "20",
        "30"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: "The midpoint of a class interval is calculated as (lower boundary + upper boundary) Ã· 2. For the interval 10-20, the midpoint is (10+20) Ã· 2 = 15.",

      correct: 3,
      explanation: "Heights are continuous data (measurable values that can take any value within a range). When recording exact heights, we preserve individual values, making it ungrouped data.",
