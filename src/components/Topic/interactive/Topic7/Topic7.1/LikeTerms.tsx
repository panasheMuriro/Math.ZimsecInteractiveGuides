    question: "What makes two algebraic terms 'like terms'?",
    options: [
      "They have the same coefficient (number).",
      "They have the same variable raised to the same power.",
      "They are next to each other in the expression.",
      "They both contain variables."
    ],
    correct: 1, // Index of "They have the same variable..."
    explanation: "Like terms are terms that have the exact same variable part, meaning the same variables raised to the same exponents. For example, $3x^2y$ and $-5x^2y$ are like terms.",

      "$3xy$ and $-xy$",
      "$5m^2n$ and $5mn^2$"
    ],
    correct: 2, // Index of "$3xy$ and $-xy$"
    explanation: "$3xy$ and $-xy$ both have the variables $x$ and $y$, each raised to the power of 1. The coefficients (3 and -1) can be different. $2a$ and $2b$ have different variables. $x^2$ and $x^3$ have the same variable but different powers. $5m^2n$ and $5mn^2$ have the same variables but the powers are swapped ($m^2n^1$ vs $m^1n^2$).",

      "$4p$ and $p^2$",
      "$4p$ and $-2p$",
      "$q$ and $p^2$"
    ],
    correct: 2, // Index of "$4p$ and $-2p$"
    explanation: "$4p$ and $-2p$ are like terms because they both contain the variable $p$ raised to the first power ($p^1$). $q$ is a different variable, and $p^2$ is $p$ raised to a different power.",

  {
    id: 'like-terms-why',
    question: "Why is it important to identify like terms?",
    options: [
      "To make the expression look neater.",
      "To multiply terms together.",
      "To add or subtract terms correctly.",
      "To find the value of the variable."
    ],
    correct: 2, // Index of "To add or subtract terms correctly."
    explanation: "Like terms represent the same type of quantity. Just like you can only add 3 apples and 2 apples to get 5 apples, you can only add or subtract like terms in algebra (e.g., $3x + 2x = 5x$).",

      "$-x^2y$",
      "$\\frac{1}{2}x^2y$",
      "$3xy^2$",
      "$7x^2y$"
    ],
    correct: 2, // Index of "$3xy^2$"
    explanation: "$3xy^2$ is not a like term with $3x^2y$ because the variables have different exponents. $3x^2y$ means $x$ is squared and $y$ is to the first power, while $3xy^2$ means $x$ is to the first power and $y$ is squared. The other options all have $x^2y^1$.",
